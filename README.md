# PWD Wordpress

This was the custom theme for the blog for the [Papers of the War Deparmtent](https://wardepartmentpapers.org/s/home/page/home) project following the redesign of the site. The blog ran on WordPress. This theme was designed to coordinate with the [theme for the Omeka S installation](https://github.com/chnm/pwd-omeka-s) which runs the main project. The theme was built using [HTML5 Blank](http://html5blank.com) as a base.

In 2021, RRCHNM flattened the blog and removed the WordPress installation. As such, RRCHNM & the *Papers of the War Department* editorial team archived this repository in February 2022. If you need more information or to unarchive this repository, please contact us at webmaster at chnm.gmu.edu
